======

Parser generator for JavaScript.

 - Based on PEG.js syntax.
 - Slow.
 - Small footprint of generated parser.

Planned
-------

There's a set of tasks which would be nice to try in Web.

 - CodeMirror-based three-way editor for grammars that shows location of parser errors and allows to debug parsers.
 - Iterative parsers for colorers and live code editors showing translated output.
 - Streamable parsers for large files.
 - Yet another typed JavaScript.

None of the parser generators I've seen allows it from the box, and none has good enough source code documentation to base the work on it.
